# capstone-project-credit-card-fraud-detection
Project Report : In this project, a credit card fraud detection classifier is developed. Here are the key points to summarize: Data Preprocessing: We loaded the credit card fraud dataset, split it into features (X) and the target variable (y), and applied feature scaling to standardize the data.

Model Training: Here three models were trained,Logistic Regression classifier,Random Forest Classifier,Gradient Boosting Classifier on the preprocessed data.

Model Evaluation: The model's performance was evaluated using accuracy, a confusion matrix, and a classification report. Accuracy provides an overall measure of correct predictions, while the confusion matrix and classification report offer a detailed breakdown of model performance, including precision, recall, F1-score, and support.

Results: The model achieved an accuracy of 0.9441624365482234, indicating its ability to correctly classify transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent. In conclusion, credit card fraud detection is crucial for financial institutions and consumers alike. While this report presents a basic implementation, further refinement and exploration of advanced techniques are essential for building robust and effective fraud detection systems.
